# Austrian Economics (Scientific Overview)

This folder documents core concepts from the Austrian school of economics in a precise, non-polemical form.

Scope:
- Strictly Austrian economics (Menger, Böhm-Bawerk, Mises, Hayek, Rothbard, Kirzner)
- Conceptual and methodological foundations
- Principles and operational definitions

Contents:
- principles.md — central theoretical principles
- definitions.md — key terms with concise definitions

Method note:
- Austrian analysis is primarily logical-deductive and process-oriented.
- It focuses on human action, time, uncertainty, and coordination under dispersed knowledge.
- It is distinct from equilibrium-heavy or aggregate-statistical macro frameworks.
