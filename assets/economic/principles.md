# Principles of Austrian Economics

Reference mapping: see [sources.md](sources.md) for canonical primary texts.

## 1) Methodological Individualism
Economic outcomes are explained by choices of individuals, not by autonomous aggregate entities.
Source mapping: [Method and Foundations](sources.md#method-and-foundations).

## 2) Subjectivism of Value
Value is subjective and ordinal: goods are valued according to individual preference rankings, not intrinsic properties.
Source mapping: [Method and Foundations](sources.md#method-and-foundations).

## 3) Marginal Analysis
Decisions are made at the margin. The relevant comparison is between additional benefits and additional opportunity costs.
Source mapping: [Method and Foundations](sources.md#method-and-foundations).

## 4) Praxeological Starting Point
Economics begins from the action axiom: humans purposefully use means to attain chosen ends.
Source mapping: [Method and Foundations](sources.md#method-and-foundations).

## 5) Time and Uncertainty are Fundamental
Production and exchange occur through time. Future conditions are uncertain, so plans are conjectural and revisable.
Source mapping: [Capital, Time, and Interest](sources.md#capital-time-and-interest) and [Prices, Knowledge, and Coordination](sources.md#prices-knowledge-and-coordination).

## 6) Capital Heterogeneity
Capital goods are diverse, specific, and arranged in intertemporal production structures. They are not a single homogeneous stock.
Source mapping: [Capital, Time, and Interest](sources.md#capital-time-and-interest).

## 7) Time Preference and Interest
Interest reflects intertemporal preference: present goods are generally valued more highly than equivalent future goods.
Source mapping: [Capital, Time, and Interest](sources.md#capital-time-and-interest).

## 8) Entrepreneurial Discovery
Entrepreneurs discover and exploit profit opportunities by noticing price discrepancies, unmet demands, and coordination errors.
Source mapping: [Prices, Knowledge, and Coordination](sources.md#prices-knowledge-and-coordination).

## 9) Prices as Knowledge Signals
Market prices communicate dispersed local information and guide plan coordination across agents.
Source mapping: [Prices, Knowledge, and Coordination](sources.md#prices-knowledge-and-coordination).

## 10) Monetary Non-Neutrality (Especially Short Run)
Changes in money and credit affect relative prices and production structure, not only a uniform price level.
Source mapping: [Money, Cycle, and Calculation](sources.md#money-cycle-and-calculation).

## 11) Business Cycle via Credit Distortion
Artificial credit expansion that pushes market rates below natural rates can induce malinvestment and unsustainable production patterns.
Source mapping: [Money, Cycle, and Calculation](sources.md#money-cycle-and-calculation).

## 12) Spontaneous Order
Complex market order can emerge from decentralized interactions under property rights and exchange, without central design.
Source mapping: [Prices, Knowledge, and Coordination](sources.md#prices-knowledge-and-coordination).

## 13) Institutional Preconditions
Secure property rights, contract enforcement, and legal predictability are prerequisites for robust calculation and coordination.
Source mapping: [Property, Institutions, and Intervention](sources.md#property-institutions-and-intervention).

## 14) Economic Calculation Argument
Without market prices for capital goods (as under full central planning), rational allocation across alternative uses becomes infeasible.
Source mapping: [Money, Cycle, and Calculation](sources.md#money-cycle-and-calculation).

## 15) Dynamic Process over Static Equilibrium
Austrians emphasize adjustment processes, disequilibrium discovery, and path dependence over comparative-static end states.
Source mapping: [Prices, Knowledge, and Coordination](sources.md#prices-knowledge-and-coordination).
