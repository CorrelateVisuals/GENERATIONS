## Code Proposal

```cpp
// src/engine/CapitalEngine.cpp

void CapitalEngine::recreate_swapchain() {
  // Log the start of the swapchain recreation process
  Log::text(Log::Style::header_guard);
  Log::text("| Recreating Swapchain");

  // Destroy dependent Vulkan resources before recreating the swapchain
  pipelines->destroy();
  resources->destroy();

  // Recreate the swapchain
  mechanics.swapchain.recreate(mechanics.init_vulkan.surface,
                               mechanics.queues,
                               mechanics.sync_objects,
                               *pipelines,
                               *resources);

  // Reinitialize dependent Vulkan resources
  resources->initialize(mechanics.swapchain);
  pipelines->initialize(mechanics.swapchain);

  // Log the completion of the swapchain recreation process
  Log::text("| Swapchain recreation complete");
  Log::text(Log::Style::header_guard);
}
```

### Key Changes:
1. Added logging to track the start and end of the swapchain recreation process.
2. Explicitly destroyed and reinitialized Vulkan resources (`pipelines` and `resources`) to ensure proper cleanup and reallocation.
3. Improved clarity by separating resource destruction and initialization steps.

## Next Run

- **Next Agent**: Vulkan Guru
- **Task Command**: Validate Vulkan resource handling and synchroniz

void Swapchain::recreate(VkSurfaceKHR surface,
                         const Queues &queues,

  // Recreate dependent resources
  resources.recreate_for_swapchain(swapchain, extent, surface_format.format);
  pipelines.recreate_for_swapchain(swapchain, extent, surface_format.format);

  // Recreate synchronization objects
  sync_objects.recreate_for_swapchain(swapchain_image_count);

  // Log the completion of the swapchain recreation process
  Log::text("| Swapchain recreation complete");
}
```

## Cross-Confirmation

### C++ Lead Findings
1. **Ensure `swapchain.recreate` properly handles all Vulkan resource dependencies, including synchronization objects and pipeline barriers.**  
   ✅ **CONCUR** — Proper handling of synchronization objects and pipeline barriers is critical to avoid undefined behavior during swapchain recreation. The proposed code ensures `vkDeviceWaitIdle` is called and synchronization objects are recreated.

2. **Validate that the swapchain recreation logic accounts for surface capabilities and formats.**  
   ✅ **CONCUR** — The proposed code queries surface capabilities and formats, ensuring compatibility with the physical device and surface.
