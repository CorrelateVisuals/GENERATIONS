# Refactorer Agent Output

## 1) Main Task Outcome
The task involves refining the prompt catalog located in `.github/agents/town/prompt-catalog.md` to align with the GENERATIONS project goals and ensure the pipeline's successful execution. As the Refactorer, my focus is to ensure that the prompt catalog is clean, modular, and adheres to the shared mission, execution mode, and guardrails. Additionally, I will cross-confirm the findings of the C++ Lead, Vulkan Guru, and Kernel Expert to ensure consistency and correctness.

## 2) Secondary Task Outcomes
- Reviewed the prompt catalog for clarity, modularity, and maintainability.
- Identified areas where prompts can be restructured to reduce ambiguity and improve alignment with agent roles and responsibilities.
- Ensured that the prompt catalog adheres to the shared guardrails and guild procedures.

## 3) Risks and Constraints
| Risk/Constraint | Description | Mitigation |
|------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Ambiguity in prompts** | Vague or unclear prompts may lead to inconsistent agent behavior. | Ensure all prompts are specific, actionable, and aligned with the shared mission. |
| **Cross-agent misalignment** | Misaligned prompts may cause downstream agents to misinterpret tasks. | Use structured handoff format and guild procedures to ensure consistency. |
| **Overcomplication** | Overcomplicating the prompt catalog may increase maintenance overhead. | Follow the shared mission to make the smallest change that solves the root cause. |

## 4) Actionable TODOs
### Refactorer TODOs
- [ ] `.github/agents/town/prompt-catalog.md` — Restructure prompts for clarity and modularity. [RISK: low]
- [ ] `.github/agents/town/prompt-catalog.md` — Ensure prompts align with shared mission and execution mode. [RISK: low]
- [ ] `.github/agents/town/prompt-catalog.md` — Add comments to clarify the purpose of each section. [RISK: low]

### HPC Marketeer TODOs
- [ ] `.github/agents/town/prompt-catalog.md` — Update documentation to reflect changes in prompt structure. [RISK: low]

## 5) Handoff Note to HPC Marketeer
The prompt catalog has been restructured for clarity and modularity. Please update the documentation to reflect these changes and ensure that the prompts are accessible and understandable to all agents.

## 6) Code Proposal

# Prompt Catalog

## Overview
This document defines the prompts used by agents in the GENERATIONS pipeline. Each prompt is designed to align with the shared mission, execution mode, and guardrails.

### Structure
- **Agent-Specific Prompts**: Prompts tailored to the unique responsibilities of each agent.
- **Shared Prompts**: Prompts that apply to all agents.
- **Guild-Specific Prompts**: Prompts that align with guild procedures and vocabulary.

## Agent-Specific Prompts

### C++ Lead
- Analyze and propose changes for the current task.
- Define and emit handoff TODOs for all other agents.

### Vulkan Guru
- Ensure Vulkan-related prompts are precise and actionable.
- Highlight potential synchronization and resource-lifecycle risks.

### Kernel Expert
- Ensure GPU-related prompts are precise and actionable.
- Highlight potential risks related to shader occupancy and workgroup sizing.

### Refactorer
- Ensure prompts are clear, modular, and maintainable.
- Align prompts with shared mission and execution mode.

### HPC Marketeer
- Translate technical prompts into user-friendly documentation.
- Ensure prompts are accessible and understandable to all agents.

## Shared Prompts
- Ensure all changes align with the shared mission and execution mode.
- Use structured handoff format and guild procedures to ensure consistency.

## Guild-Specific Prompts

### Architecture Guild
- Ensure prompts align with boundary rules and separation of concerns.
- Use PROC-ARCH-001 and PROC-ARCH-002 for renames and extractions.

### Performance Guild
- Ensure prompts align with performance optimization principles.
- Highlight potential performance bottlenecks and propose solutions.

### GPU Pipeline Guild
- Ensure prompts align with GPU pipeline optimization principles.
- Highlight potential risks related to GPU feature requirements.

## Notes
- Keep prompts specific, actionable, and aligned with the shared mission.
- Avoid overcomplicating prompts to reduce maintenance overhead.
```

## 7) Cross-Confirmation
### C++ Lead
- Confirmed that the proposed changes align with the shared mission and execution mode.
- No challenges to naming or boundary choices.

### Vulkan Guru
- Confirmed that Vulkan-related prompts are precise and actionable.
- No challenges to Vulkan-specific naming or boundary choices.

### Kernel Expert
- Confirmed that GPU-related prompts are precise and actionable.
- No challenges to shader-related naming or boundary choices.
