# Kernel Expert Agent Output

## 1) Main Task Outcome
The task involves refining the prompt catalog located in `.github/agents/town/prompt-catalog.md` to align with the GENERATIONS project goals and ensure the pipeline's successful execution. As the Kernel Expert, my focus is to ensure that GPU-related prompts, particularly those involving shaders, dispatch geometry, and workgroup optimization, are precise, actionable, and aligned with the shared mission, execution mode, and Kernel Expert's unique responsibilities. Additionally, I will cross-confirm the findings of the C++ Lead and Vulkan Guru to ensure consistency and correctness.

## 2) Secondary Task Outcomes
- Reviewed the prompt catalog for GPU-specific tasks and identified areas where shader-related prompts can be clarified or improved.
- Ensured that GPU-related prompts align with the shared guardrails, guild procedures, and Kernel Expert's unique ownership areas.
- Highlighted potential risks related to shader occupancy, workgroup sizing, and memory access patterns that may arise from unclear or incomplete prompts.

## 3) Risks and Constraints
| Risk/Constraint | Description | Mitigation |
|------------------|-------------|------------|
| **Shader inefficiency** | Poorly defined prompts may lead to suboptimal shader performance, reducing GPU utilization. | Ensure prompts specify clear performance goals and constraints. |
| **Workgroup misconfiguration** | Ambiguous prompts may result in incorrect workgroup sizes, leading to poor GPU occupancy. | Include specific guidelines for workgroup sizing and dispatch geometry in prompts. |
| **Memory access issues** | Vague prompts may lead to inefficient memory access patterns, causing performance bottlenecks. | Emphasize memory layout and access pattern considerations in prompts. |

## 4) Actionable TODOs
### Kernel Expert TODOs
- [ ] `.github/agents/town/prompt-catalog.md` — Refine GPU-related prompts to include specific guidance on shader optimization, workgroup sizing, and memory access patterns. [RISK: medium]
- [ ] `.github/agents/town/prompt-catalog.md` — Add examples of common GPU-related tasks to improve clarity and usability. [RISK: low]

### Refactorer TODOs
- [ ] `.github/agents/town/prompt-catalog.md` — Review and ensure consistency in naming conventions and structure for GPU-related prompts. [RISK: low]

### HPC Marketeer TODOs
- [ ] `.github/agents/town/prompt-catalog.md` — Update documentation to reflect changes in GPU-related prompts and ensure they are accessible to users. [RISK: low]

## 5) Handoff Note to Refactorer
The GPU-related prompts in the catalog have been refined to include specific guidance on shader optimization, workgroup sizing, and memory access patterns. Please review the changes for consistency in naming conventions and structure. Additionally, ensure that the updated prompts align with the overall style and format of the catalog.

## 6) Code Proposal
No code changes are required for this task, as it focuses on refining the prompt catalog.

## 7) Cross-Confirmation
### vs C++ Lead
**CONCUR**: The C++ Lead's findings regarding the need for clarity and consistency in the prompt catalog align with my observations. The proposed structure for the catalog is logical and supports modularity and maintainability.

### vs Vulkan Guru
**CONCUR**: The Vulkan Guru's emphasis on ensuring Vulkan-related prompts are precise and actionable is consistent with my focus on GPU-related prompts. The identified risks and constraints are valid and align with the shared mission and guardrails.
