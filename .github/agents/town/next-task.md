- **C++ Lead**: - **Next Agent**: Vulkan Guru
- **Task Command**: CHARGE-SWAPCHAIN-RECREATION

The Vulkan Guru should:
1. Review the `Swapchain::recreate` method to ensure proper cleanup and reinitialization of Vulkan resources.
2. Verify that the proposed changes in `recreate_swapchain` align with Vulkan best practices.
3. Confirm that the Vulkan resource semantics are correctly handled during swapchain recreation.
- **Vulkan Guru**: - **Next Agent**: Kernel Expert
- **Task Command**: CHARGE-SWAPCHAIN-RECREATION
- **Reason**: The Kernel Expert should validate the proposed changes to ensure that the swapchain recreation process does not negatively impact GPU performance, particularly in terms of synchronization, pipeline barriers, and resource usage.
