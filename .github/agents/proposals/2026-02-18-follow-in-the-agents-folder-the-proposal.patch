 # Prompt Catalog

 ## Overview
-This document defines the prompts used by agents in the GENERATIONS pipeline.
+This document defines the prompts used by agents in the GENERATIONS pipeline. Each prompt is designed to align with the shared mission, execution mode, and guardrails.

+### General Guidelines
+- Ensure all prompts are specific, actionable, and aligned with the shared mission.
+- Use structured handoff formats for all TODOs.
+- Follow guild procedures for task patterns.
+
 ## Agent-Specific Prompts

 ### C++ Lead
-- "Analyze the task and define handoff TODOs for all other agents."
-- "Focus on runtime optimization and architectural boundaries."
+- "Analyze the task and define handoff TODOs for all other agents. Ensure recommendations are concrete and file-scoped."
+- "Focus on runtime optimization and architectural boundaries. Avoid speculative abstractions."
+
+### Vulkan Guru
+- "Validate Vulkan resource semantics and synchronization. Ensure alignment with GPU Pipeline Guild procedures."
+- "Review Vulkan-specific prompts for clarity and correctness. Add explicit instructions for synchronization and resource lifecycle management."
+
+### Kernel Expert
+- "Optimize GPU utilization and shader performance. Follow PROC-PERF-001 and PROC-PERF-002."
+- "Ensure compatibility between shader and dispatch configurations. Include specific guidance on workgroup sizing and memory access patterns."
+
+### Refactorer
+- "Refine naming and structure for clarity and consistency. Validate against architectural boundaries."
+- "Ensure prompt updates reduce complexity and improve maintainability."
